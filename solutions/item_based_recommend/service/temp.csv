0|Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and   LHC energies|A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.|hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0001.pdf
1|Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions|We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and Westermann and Hendrickson.|math.CO cs.CG|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0002.pdf
2|The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on the dark matter field   fluid model|The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).|physics.gen-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0003.pdf

5|Bosonic characters of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance|We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.|cond-mat.mes-hall|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0006.pdf
6|Polymer Quantum Mechanics and its Continuum Limit|A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple cosmological model.|gr-qc|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0007.pdf
7|Numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material   properties|A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0008.pdf
8|The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds. IX. The   Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC and MIPS|We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0009.pdf
9|Partial cubes: structures, characterizations, and constructions|Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given.   The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated.|math.CO|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0010.pdf
10|Computing genus 2 Hilbert-Siegel modular forms over $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ via   the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence|In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field $\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms.|math.NT math.AG|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0011.pdf
11|Distribution of integral Fourier Coefficients of a Modular Form of Half   Integral Weight Modulo Primes|Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_f(n)q ^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that does not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In this paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms of half integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. As applications of our main theorem we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\geq5$, of traces of singular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's conjecture for overpartitions.|math.NT|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0012.pdf
12|$p$-adic Limit of Weakly Holomorphic Modular Forms of Half Integral   Weight|Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of modular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of Eisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting.|math.NT|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0013.pdf

15|Lifetime of doubly charmed baryons|In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We carefully calculate the non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppressed diagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the simple non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results are generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark model. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one order larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate experiment still confirms the value of the SELEX collaboration, there must be some unknown mechanism to be explored.|hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0016.pdf
16|Spectroscopic Observations of the Intermediate Polar EX Hydrae in   Quiescence|Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600 km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion curtain model.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0017.pdf

We think that the regulator used in this Letter can be applied to this index problem.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0018.pdf

19|Measurement of the Hadronic Form Factor in D0 --> K- e+ nue Decays|The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue has been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical calculations. We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction, relative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0 --> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From these results, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), the normalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and from external inputs, respectively.|hep-ex|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0020.pdf

21|Stochastic Lie group integrators|We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes. Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.|math.NA|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0022.pdf
22|ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere|The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics, remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research. Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8 mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of the comprehensive dynamic simulations.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0023.pdf
23|Formation of quasi-solitons in transverse confined ferromagnetic film   media|The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges.   In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement.|nlin.PS|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0024.pdf

Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or "Sky" when it is interpreted as the "strut constant" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called "Box-Kites" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs).

The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band in graphene Raman spectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 -> (+,1) and (-,1) -> 0, at a magnetic field B_0 ~ 30 T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice modes.|cond-mat.mes-hall|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0027.pdf

28|Understanding the Flavor Symmetry Breaking and Nucleon Flavor-Spin   Structure within Chiral Quark Model|In $\XQM$, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking in the Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon flavor-spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure of constituent quarks implied in $\XQM$ caused by the Goldstone boson emission process in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from $\XQM$, the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then the obtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from a quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking in nucleon flavor-spin structure.|hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0029.pdf
29|Tuning correlation effects with electron-phonon interactions|We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement|cond-mat.str-el|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0030.pdf
30|Crystal channeling of LHC forward protons with preserved distribution in   phase space|We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC.|hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0031.pdf
31|Probing non-standard neutrino interactions with supernova neutrinos|We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a future galactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrino propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$.|hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0032.pdf
32|Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. I. Theoretical   analysis|We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers. Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.|physics.optics physics.comp-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0033.pdf

An extrapolation   technique to increase the accuracy|We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case.|physics.optics physics.comp-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0035.pdf
35|A remark on the number of steady states in a multiple futile cycle|The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1 steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one steady state.|q-bio.QM q-bio.MN|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0036.pdf
36|The discrete dipole approximation for simulation of light scattering by   particles much larger than the wavelength|In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and 2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory. Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed.|physics.optics physics.comp-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0037.pdf

We put the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking the viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the electric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects, the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the method. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light scattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed.|physics.optics physics.comp-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0038.pdf
38|Scalar radius of the pion and zeros in the form factor|The quadratic pion scalar radius, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s, plays an important role for present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain, using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es equations, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.61\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\'ain's method and show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from QCD.|hep-ph hep-lat nucl-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0039.pdf

40|Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical and Noncommutative Geometry|We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group) in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.|math.QA math-ph math.MP|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0041.pdf
41|General System theory, Like-Quantum Semantics and Fuzzy Sets|It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum coherence.|physics.gen-ph quant-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0042.pdf
42|Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods|We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i) based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy "trimming") and (ii) based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples: 1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid. All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic quasiequilibria.|cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0043.pdf
43|Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in   magnetized weakly collisional plasmas|We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks). The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the "inertial range" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the "dissipation range" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical applications are discussed in detail.|astro-ph nlin.CD physics.plasm-ph physics.space-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0044.pdf
44|Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows   over a gradual slope with bottom friction|This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media.|nlin.PS nlin.SI|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0045.pdf
45|A limit relation for entropy and channel capacity per unit cost|In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in this paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the quantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to generalization of the conjecture.|quant-ph cs.IT math.IT|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0046.pdf
46|Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:   Part I|The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.   The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by the acoustic emission method.|cs.NE cs.AI|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0047.pdf

We implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent pre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal parameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest.|gr-qc astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0048.pdf

There are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 6-polytopes and 72256 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 7-polytopes.|math.CO|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0049.pdf
49|Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:   Part II|Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two continuous acoustic emission sources.   Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission analysis.|cs.NE cs.AI|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0050.pdf

51|Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds. II. Spacetime Symmetries|We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including interacting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the isometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either self-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the self-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian manifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose Lorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0052.pdf
52|A Global Approach to the Theory of Special Finsler Manifolds|The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald, Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible, semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent, $C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of the second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like, $R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special Finsler spaces considered.|math.DG gr-qc|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0053.pdf

54|Potassium intercalation in graphite: A van der Waals density-functional   study|Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.|cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0055.pdf
55|Phase diagram of Gaussian-core nematics|We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel ellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive Gaussian law. After identifying the relevant solid phases of the system through a careful zero-temperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures, we determine the melting temperature for various pressure values, also with the help of exact free energy calculations. Among the prominent features of this model are pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnar phase for intermediate temperatures.|cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0056.pdf
56|High-spin to low-spin and orbital polarization transitions in   multiorbital Mott systems|We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective Mott state.|cond-mat.str-el|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0057.pdf
57|Intelligent Life in Cosmology|I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims.|physics.pop-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0058.pdf
58|The Mass and Radius of the Unseen M-Dwarf Companion in the Single-Lined   Eclipsing Binary HAT-TR-205-013|We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU. Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04 \pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0059.pdf
59|Coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei at intermediate energies|We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed.|nucl-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0060.pdf
60|Intersection Bodies and Generalized Cosine Transforms|Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking   Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call $\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of $L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some known facts and give them new proofs.|math.FA|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0061.pdf
61|On-line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks|In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$, without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm. Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both simulated and real DNA sequences.|cs.DS|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0062.pdf
62|Experimental efforts in search of 76Ge Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay|Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed.|hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0063.pdf
63|Nilpotent symmetry invariance in the superfield formulation: the   (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories|We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of the Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular, we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism. Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu = 0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One of the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry invariance.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0064.pdf
64|Littlewood-Richardson polynomials|We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A. Okounkov and G. Olshanski.|math.AG math.CO|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0065.pdf
65|Lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. IV. Commutation   relations for free fields|Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not contradict to the existing data.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0066.pdf
66|Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots: Linear Analysis|Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers, photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0067.pdf

68|Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps|The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient "marching orders" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the smooth and holomorphic setting.|math.DS|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0069.pdf

71|The decomposition method and Maple procedure for finding first integrals   of nonlinear PDEs of any order with any number of independent variables|In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders. It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s), each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE. Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its highest derivatives.   The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.|math-ph math.MP|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0072.pdf

We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectral sequence.|math.AG|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0073.pdf
73|Injective Morita contexts (revisited)|This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita $\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum. We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and injective right wide Morita contexts.|math.RA|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0074.pdf

In addition to providing us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown how it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem.|physics.gen-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0077.pdf

These algebras, which generalise the analytic Toeplitz algebras of rank 2 graphs with a single vertex, are classified up to isometric isomorphism in terms of the matrix $u$.|math.OA|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0079.pdf
79|Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by Stellar-Dynamical   Evaporation|We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by -dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal ``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc. Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties (rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values (although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the globular cluster system.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0080.pdf

81|Matter-Wave Bright Solitons with a Finite Background in Spinor   Bose-Einstein Condensates|We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs.|cond-mat.other cond-mat.stat-mech|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0082.pdf
82|Why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)?|The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested density matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble in quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one) distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the {\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the bounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and, simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0083.pdf
83|Formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely   cooling inelastic gases: a family of exact solutions|We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim (t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an "ordinary" shock, at which the hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally, independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.|cond-mat.soft nlin.PS physics.flu-dyn|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0084.pdf
84|A Universality in PP-Waves|We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0085.pdf
85|Clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas|We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles.|math.PR|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0086.pdf

Then for each $\epsilon >0$ there exists a harmonic map $u:H^m\to H^n$ which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense of Euclidean) and $u|_{\partial H^m}=(f^1,...,f^{n-1},\epsilon)$.|math.DG|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0087.pdf

Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boiling point (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long- term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structured spectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visible luminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificial opals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated with different nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced and the spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface is being changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on the Cu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species of the liquids. Temporal characteristics of this luminiscence are nearly the same as in opal matrixes.|physics.optics|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0088.pdf
88|A general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws:   nonparametric regression|Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.|physics.data-an physics.gen-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0089.pdf

92|Aspects of Electron-Phonon Self-Energy Revealed from Angle-Resolved   Photoemission Spectroscopy|Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlated oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions. Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), including the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects, the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these arguments are not well founded.|cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0093.pdf
93|Timing and Lensing of the Colliding Bullet Clusters: barely enough time   and gravity to accelerate the bullet|We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments. We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data. {\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the "bullet" X-ray gas can move with V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x 10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of $4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter $M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le 1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0094.pdf
94|Geometry of Locally Compact Groups of Polynomial Growth and Shape of   Large Balls|We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series of nilpotent groups.|math.GR math.DG|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0095.pdf

98|On Ando's inequalities for convex and concave functions|For positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, Ando and Zhan proved the inequalities $||| f(A)+f(B) ||| \ge ||| f(A+B) |||$ and $||| g(A)+g(B) ||| \le ||| g(A+B) |||$, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negative operator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These inequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave functions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama, and Kosem, respectively.   In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $||| f(A)-f(B) ||| \le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \ge ||| g(|A-B|) |||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a similar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer exactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively in the special case when $A\ge ||B||$.   In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated majorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself a Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows to strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.|math.FA|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0099.pdf
99|Topology Change of Black Holes|The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii) Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from that with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat space-times.|gr-qc|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0100.pdf

In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds.

105|Multiple Parton Scattering in Nuclei: Quark-quark Scattering|Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to quark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied systematically up to order \cal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\cal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark (antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark) distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.|hep-ph nucl-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0106.pdf

112|Langmuir blodgett assembly of densely aligned single walled carbon   nanotubes from bulk materials|Single walled carbon nanotubes exhibit advanced electrical and surface properties useful for high performance nanoelectronics. Important to future manufacturing of nanotube circuits is large scale assembly of SWNTs into aligned forms. Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine SWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high current, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel SWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of aligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer functionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in an organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film compression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and packing of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by microfabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest regions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0113.pdf
113|Quantum Phase Transition in the Four-Spin Exchange Antiferromagnet|We study the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor and plaquette four-spin exchanges (introduced by A.W. Sandvik, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 227202 (2007).)   This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneously dimerized phase to N\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as the critical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibits strong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a low-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle density. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense at the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach, which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the transition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the critical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding the order of the transition.|cond-mat.str-el|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0114.pdf

In the strong-excitation regime and without the restriction of Lamb-Dicke limit, the Hamiltonian of the system is similar to a driving Jaynes-Cummings model without rotating wave approximation (RWA). The approach we developed enables us to present a complete eigensolutions, which makes it available to compare with the solutions under the RWA. We find that, the ground state in our non-RWA solution is energically lower than the counterpart under the RWA. If we have the ion in the ground state, it is equivalent to a spin dependent force on the trapped ion. Discussion is made for the difference between the solutions with and without the RWA, and for the relevant experimental test, as well as for the possible application in quantum information processing.|quant-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0117.pdf
117|Strained single-crystal Al2O3 grown layer-by-layer on Nb (110) thin   films|We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire, followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth. Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer, the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic.|cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0118.pdf
118|Quasi-quartet crystal electric field ground state in a tetragonal   CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystal|We have successfully grown the single crystals of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$, for the first time, by flux method and studied the anisotropic physical properties by measuring the electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. We found that CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_{\rm N}$ = 4.6 K. The electrical resistivity and susceptibility data reveal strong anisotropic magnetic properties. The magnetization measured at $T$ = 2 K exhibited two metamagnetic transitions at $H_{\rm m1}$ = 31 kOe and $H_{\rm m2}$ = 44.7 kOe, for $H \parallel$ [100] with a saturation magnetization of 1.6 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce. The crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the inverse susceptibility data reveals that the ground state and the first excited states of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ are closely spaced indicating a quasi-quartet ground state. The specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spaced energy levels.|cond-mat.str-el|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0119.pdf

In this paper, we discuss the constraints on the strong phase difference in $D^0 \to K\pi$ decay from the measurements of the mixing parameters, $y^\prime$, $y_{CP}$ and $x$ at the $B$ factories. The sensitivity of the measurement of the mixing parameter $y$ is estimated in BES-III experiment at $\psi(3770)$ peak. We also make an estimate on the measurements of the mixing rate $R_M$. Finally, the sensitivity of the strong phase difference at BES-III are obtained by using data near the $D\bar{D}$ threshold with CP tag technique at BES-III experiment.|hep-ex hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0120.pdf

By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold 6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c') gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0121.pdf

By solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we find several novel spin textures where the mass density and spin density are strongly coupled, depending upon trap geometries due to the long-range and anisotropic natures of the dipole-dipole interaction.|cond-mat.other|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0122.pdf
122|Nonlinear Dynamics of the Phonon Stimulated Emission in Microwave   Solid-State Resonator of the Nonautonomous Phaser Generator|The microwave phonon stimulated emission (SE) has been experimentally and numerically investigated in a nonautonomous microwave acoustic quantum generator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous works arXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050) Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.|nlin.CD cond-mat.other physics.optics|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0123.pdf

125|I-V characteristics of the vortex state in MgB2 thin films|The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have been studied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0H between 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V isotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles. Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.|cond-mat.supr-con|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0126.pdf
126|Magnetic Fingerprints of sub-100 nm Fe Nanodots|Sub-100 nm nanomagnets not only are technologically important, but also exhibit complex magnetization reversal behaviors as their dimensions are comparable to typical magnetic domain wall widths. Here we capture magnetic "fingerprints" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to vortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As the nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal striking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis loops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity distribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a calculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm nanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the vortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives quantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation and annihilation fields.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0127.pdf
127|An online repository of Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs|Context. Swift data are revolutionising our understanding of Gamma Ray Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate accurate light curves rapidly.   Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as necessary for a fading source.   Results. The light curve repository website (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed.

The model consists in that the vacuum is, briefly, filled of neutral but polarizable vacuuons, consisting each of a p-vaculeon and n- vaculeon of charges $+e$ and $-e$ of zero rest masses but with spin motions, assumed interacting each other with a Coulomb force. The model has been introduced in full in a book (Nova Sci, 2005) and referred to in a number of journal/E-print papers.

131|Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts|We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC.|cond-mat.mes-hall|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0132.pdf

The ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing).

133|Causal dissipative hydrodynamics for QGP fluid in 2+1 dimensions|In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations. Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics. For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics.|nucl-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0134.pdf
134|A Single Trapped Ion as a Time-Dependent Harmonic Oscillator|We show how a single trapped ion may be used to test a variety of important physical models realized as time-dependent harmonic oscillators. The ion itself functions as its own motional detector through laser-induced electronic transitions. Alsing et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 220401 (2005)] proposed that an exponentially decaying trap frequency could be used to simulate (thermal) Gibbons-Hawking radiation in an expanding universe, but the Hamiltonian used was incorrect. We apply our general solution to this experimental proposal, correcting the result for a single ion and showing that while the actual spectrum is different from the Gibbons-Hawking case, it nevertheless shares an important experimental signature with this result.|quant-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0135.pdf

136|Topological defects, geometric phases, and the angular momentum of light|Recent reports on the intriguing features of vector vortex bearing beams are analyzed using geometric phases in optics. It is argued that the spin redirection phase induced circular birefringence is the origin of topological phase singularities arising in the inhomogeneous polarization patterns. A unified picture of recent results is presented based on this proposition. Angular momentum shift within the light beam (OAM) has exact equivalence with the angular momentum holonomy associated with the geometric phase consistent with our conjecture.|quant-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0137.pdf
137|Circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr   spacetimes|We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite to the "normal" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to the black hole, they were named "nearly horizon-skimming orbits". Our analysis generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric) family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.|gr-qc astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0138.pdf
138|The Blue Straggler Population of the Globular Cluster M5|By combining high-resolution HST and wide-field ground based observations, in ultraviolet and optical bands, we study the Blue Stragglers Star (BSS) population of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central regions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the cluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a bimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular clusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations suggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar collisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer processes in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial distribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal radius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an "evaporating" BSS.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0139.pdf
139|Entanglement entropy of two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter black holes|Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0140.pdf

141|Some aspects of the nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model|A nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model is considered. First we integrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes with wave vectors +/- q. Then we are looking for the RG equation which would describe the transformation of the Hamiltonian under the integration over a shell Lambda - d Lambda < k < Lambda, where d Lambda -> 0. We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equation is consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integration results for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of the phi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We compare the expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammatic perturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in which sense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact.|cond-mat.stat-mech|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0142.pdf

We find that the diffusion of the distribution function $\rho(\phi,t)$ of the inflaton expectation value in different Hubble patches may be suppressed due to the effect analogous to the Anderson localization in disordered quantum systems. At $t \to \infty$ only the localized part of the distribution function $\rho (\phi, t)$ survives which leads to dynamical selection principle on the landscape. The probability to measure any but a small value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubble patch on the landscape is exponentially suppressed at $t\to \infty$.|hep-th astro-ph gr-qc|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0144.pdf

145|Vortices in Bose-Einstein Condensates: Theory|Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf r}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids. In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear optics, and type-II superconductors.|cond-mat.other|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0146.pdf

A 4, 433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect of stochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization of transmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Mueller transformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It is observed that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive operator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. This observation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne (Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantum measurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elements can be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a way of realizing different types of Mueller devices.|physics.optics physics.class-ph quant-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0147.pdf
147|Reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from   equation-of-motion approach|The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, in semiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach for different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various mechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon interaction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the electron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine interaction are included. The relative contributions from these spin decoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the spin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked effect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either in Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature, though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0148.pdf

149|Magnetism and Thermodynamics of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Diamond Chains in a   Magnetic Field|The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond chains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0 (frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0 (non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and $4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition, the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with our TMRG results.|cond-mat.str-el|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0150.pdf
150|Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data|The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability density functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x) the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy. With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly related variables.|physics.data-an physics.comp-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0151.pdf
151|Kinetic equation for finite systems of fermions with pairing|The solutions of the Wigner-transformed time-dependent Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov equations are studied in the constant-$\Delta$ approximation. This approximation is known to violate particle-number conservation. As a consequence, the density fluctuation and the longitudinal response function given by this approximation contain spurious contributions. A simple prescription for restoring both local and global particle-number conservation is proposed. Explicit expressions for the eigenfrequencies of the correlated systems and for the density response function are derived and it is shown that the semiclassical analogous of the quantum single--particle spectrum has an excitation gap of $2\Delta$, in agreement with the quantum result. The collective response is studied for a simplified form of the residual interaction.|nucl-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0152.pdf
152|Reciprocal Symmetry and Classical Discrete Oscillator Incorporating   Half-Integral Energy Levels|Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding (finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to 0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of half-integers.|physics.gen-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0153.pdf
153|Hadrons in Medium -- Theory confronts experiment|In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson we demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian; more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be part of any reliable theory.|nucl-th hep-ph nucl-ex|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0154.pdf
154|A computer program for fast non-LTE analysis of interstellar line   spectra|The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line observations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and chemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. We present a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecular lines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibrium calculations involving collisional and radiative processes and including radiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an escape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml . The program makes use of molecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The performance of the program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticated methods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters from line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program should form an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radio and infrared telescopes.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0155.pdf

156|Alternative Approaches to the Equilibrium Properties of Hard-Sphere   Liquids|An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation theory of fluids are briefly addressed.|cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0157.pdf

The exponent for the scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at $\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths, respectively.|q-bio.OT|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0158.pdf
158|Evidence for an excitonic insulator phase in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$|We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$ in both, its room-temperature, normal phase and its low-temperature, charge-density wave phase. At low temperature the photoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of spectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral function for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features with very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonic insulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$.|cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.soft|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0159.pdf
159|Oxygen-rich droplets and the enrichment of the ISM|We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundances derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs) might well be the signature of a scenario of the enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario, the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed ORL-CEL discrepancy.

The phonon frequencies and eigen vectors obtained from ab-initio calculations are used for the assignment of the observed phonon spectra. Out of the eleven zone-centre optical modes, six modes exhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the soft phonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit, with librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion.

161|Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics|Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.|physics.data-an physics.comp-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0162.pdf
162|Effective potentials for quasicrystals from ab-initio data|Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale atomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results crucially depends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys like quasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically inexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials especially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force matching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co, icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0163.pdf
163|On smooth foliations with Morse singularities|Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$ foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere. In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type result.|math.GT|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0164.pdf

We give a closed formula for the mth Frobenius-Schur indicator, m>1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. We deduce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m, the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. For the classical Lie algebras sl(n), so(2n), so(2n+1) and sp(2n), this is the case for m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n+1, respectively.|math.QA math.RT|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0165.pdf
165|Supersymmetry breaking metastable vacua in runaway quiver gauge theories|In this paper we consider quiver gauge theories with fractional branes whose infrared dynamics removes the classical supersymmetric vacua (DSB branes). We show that addition of flavors to these theories (via additional non-compact branes) leads to local meta-stable supersymmetry breaking minima, closely related to those of SQCD with massive flavors. We simplify the study of the one-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct computation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach allows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the results for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to generalize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary values of the superpotential couplings.|hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0166.pdf

Particles undergo pitch angle diffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and also emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviour of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with the particle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are discussed.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0168.pdf

The anomalous first-order character of the transition to the spin-Peierls phase is found to be a consequence of the different symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1}/m$) phases.   The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly suggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the formation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, a comparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energy scattering observed previously has a phononic origin.|cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0170.pdf
170|Discovery of a point-like very-high-energy gamma-ray source in Monoceros|The complex Monoceros Loop SNR/Rosette Nebula region contains several potential sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission and two as yet unidentified high-energy EGRET sources. Sensitive VHE observations are required to probe acceleration processes in this region. The H.E.S.S. telescope array has been used to search for very high-energy gamma-ray sources in this region. CO data from the NANTEN telescope were used to map the molecular clouds in the region, which could act as target material for gamma-ray production via hadronic interactions. We announce the discovery of a new gamma-ray source, HESS J0632+058, located close to the rim of the Monoceros SNR. This source is unresolved by H.E.S.S. and has no clear counterpart at other wavelengths but is possibly associated with the weak X-ray source 1RXS J063258.3+054857, the Be-star MWC 148 and/or the lower energy gamma-ray source 3EG J0634+0521.

173|Reparametrization Invariance, the controversial extraction of $\alpha$   from $B\to\pi\pi$ and New Physics|The extraction of the weak phase $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ decays has been controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian confrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have not deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$. Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$ through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around $\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.|hep-ph hep-ex|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0174.pdf
174|Solar System Constraints on Gauss-Bonnet Mediated Dark Energy|Although the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant for general relativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence scalar field, modifying gravity at solar system scales. We determine the solar system constraints due to this term by evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributional source. We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential, and also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. We constrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini spacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always finding extremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We discuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological acceleration.|astro-ph gr-qc hep-th|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0175.pdf

The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.|cond-mat.other cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0176.pdf

Using the magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer we are able to produce magnetic domains with two different crystallographic orientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample at the same time. We find a huge difference in the XMLD contrast between the two types of magnetic domains, which we discuss in terms of intrinsic magneto-crystalline anisotropy of XMLD of the Co layer. We also demonstrate that due to the high sensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe moments at the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD in a metallic system.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0182.pdf

We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its structural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in compression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing temperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit, Young's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10, 0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of 300K to 900K.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0183.pdf

Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model.

186|The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on the line of   sight towards HE 2347-4342|We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342: QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302, $\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$ arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338. Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest. Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0187.pdf

We also analyze transport properties along the spine for these probability measures.|cond-mat.other|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0188.pdf

The monoids M_{k,1} have connections with circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove that M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green relations J and D are characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and they have k-1 non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz algebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over any finite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certain infinite generating sets.   Changes in this version: Section 4 has been thoroughly revised, and errors have been corrected; however, the main results of Section 4 do not change. Sections 1, 2, and 3 are unchanged, except for the proof of Theorem 2.3, which was incomplete; a complete proof was published in the Appendix of reference [6], and is also given here.|math.GR|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0189.pdf

In the present paper, we examine the validity of [the SK assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. Concretely speaking, we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [Time Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of the SK assumption. In our [Time Sequential Simulation], we simulate every physical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.   From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.|hep-ex astro-ph hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0190.pdf
190|Intricate Knots in Proteins: Function and Evolution|A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a knotted structure in this protein.|physics.bio-ph physics.data-an q-bio.BM|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0191.pdf
191|Star Formation in Galaxies with Large Lower Surface Brightness Disks|We present B, R, and Halpha imaging data of 19 large disk galaxies whose properties are intermediate between classical low surface brightness galaxies and ordinary high surface brightness galaxies. We use data taken from the Lowell 1.8m Perkins telescope to determine the galaxies' overall morphology, color, and star formation properties. Morphologically, the galaxies range from Sb through Irr and include galaxies with and without nuclear bars. The colors of the galaxies vary from B-R = 0.3 - 1.9, and most show at least a slight bluing of the colors with increasing radius. The Halpha images of these galaxies show an average star formation rate lower than is found for similar samples with higher surface brightness disks. Additionally, the galaxies studied have both higher gas mass-to-luminosity and diffuse Halpha emission than is found in higher surface brightness samples.|astro-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0192.pdf
192|Domain Wall Dynamics near a Quantum Critical Point|We study the real-time domain-wall dynamics near a quantum critical point of the one-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnetic spin 1/2 chain. By numerical simulation, we find the domain wall is dynamically stable in the Heisenberg-Ising model. Near the quantum critical point, the width of the domain wall diverges as $(\Delta -1) ^{-1/2}$.|cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.stat-mech|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0193.pdf
193|Quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by   fluctuating environment|We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model. The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling. Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency, depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.|cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0194.pdf
194|Group-theoretical properties of nilpotent modular categories|We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs).|math.QA math.RT|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0195.pdf
195|Remarks on N_c dependence of decays of exotic baryons|We calculate the N_c dependence of the decay widths of exotic eikosiheptaplet within the framework of Chral Quark Soliton Model. We also discuss generalizations of regular baryon representations for arbitrary N_c.|hep-ph|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0196.pdf
196|Analysis of random Boolean networks using the average sensitivity|In this work we consider random Boolean networks that provide a general model for genetic regulatory networks. We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was able to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random networks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in the disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.|nlin.CG|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0197.pdf
197|Theory of polariton mediated Raman scattering in microcavities|We calculate the intensity of the polariton mediated inelastic light scattering in semiconductor microcavities. We treat the exciton-photon coupling nonperturbatively and incorporate lifetime effects in both excitons and photons, and a coupling of the photons to the electron-hole continuum. Taking the matrix elements as fitting parameters, the results are in excellent agreement with measured Raman intensities due to optical phonons resonant with the upper polariton branches in II-VI microcavities with embedded CdTe quantum wells.|cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.other|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0198.pdf
198|Decomposition numbers for finite Coxeter groups and generalised   non-crossing partitions|Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, and types $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter groups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\si_1\si_2 cdots\si_d$ of a Coxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in a subgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisation is "minimal" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s, $i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$ decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$ decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new. These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and fixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le \pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the "block structure" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras. Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which, in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.|math.CO math.GR|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0199.pdf
199|Electromagnetic polarizabilities and the excited states of the nucleon|The electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon are shown to be essentially composed of the nonresonant $\alpha_p(E_{0+})=+3.2$, $\alpha_n(E_{0+})=+4.1$,the $t$-channel $\alpha^t_{p,n}=-\beta^t_{p,n}=+7.6$ and the resonant $\beta_{p,n}(P_{33}(1232))=+8.3$ contributions (in units of $10^{-4}$fm$^3$. The remaining deviations from the experimental data $\Delta\alpha_p=1.2\pm 0.6$, $\Delta\beta_p=1.2\mp 0.6$, \Delta\alpha_n=0.8\pm 1.7$ and $\Delta\beta_n=2.0\mp 1.8$ are contributed by a larger number of resonant and nonresonant processes with cancellations between the contributions. This result confirms that dominant contributions to the electric and magnetic polarizabilities may be represented in terms of two-photon couplings to the $\sigma$-meson having the predicted mass $m_\sigma=666$ MeV and two-photon width $\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}=2.6$ keV.|hep-ph nucl-ex|https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0200.pdf
